PMC4136787,"Following a 16-year hiatus, Russia’s Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission, launched in 2013, represented a renewed effort in biomedical research utilizing spaceflight. The primary focus was on understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation to microgravity, specifically targeting the mouse as a model organism. The mission’s success hinged on a meticulously designed training and selection program for the mice, aiming to mitigate the stresses of spaceflight and ensure data quality.

The core strategy involved housing male C57/BL6 mice in groups, a challenging undertaking due to potential aggression. To address this, a co-adaptation program was implemented, alongside adaptation to a “space” paste food diet – a novel approach designed to replicate the nutritional constraints of spaceflight. Mice designated for in vivo studies underwent a broader training regimen, including a behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements within their home-cage. Preliminary test results were used to select homogenous groups, maximizing the consistency of data.

During the 30-day flight, continuous blood pressure monitoring and behavioral observations were conducted. Post-flight, extensive testing was performed, encompassing memory, learning, vestibular function, physical activity, and cardiovascular parameters. Tissue samples were collected for in vitro studies, analyzing metabolic, morphological, and molecular changes induced by microgravity. 

The training program was deemed effective, enabling the successful deployment of male mice in space biomedical research. The mission’s data collection methods, including automated behavioral monitoring and telemetry, were designed to minimize stress on the animals and maximize the scientific yield. The results highlighted pronounced disadaptation to Earth’s gravity following the flight, underscoring the significant physiological changes induced by prolonged exposure to microgravity."
PMC3630201,"This study investigated the effects of short-term spaceflight on bone structure and cellular activity in mature mice, specifically focusing on the pelvic region. Researchers observed a significant reduction in bone volume fraction (6.23%) and overall bone thickness (11.91%) within the ischial region of the pelvis following 22 days of spaceflight, indicating a measurable loss of bone mass. Importantly, the study revealed that this bone loss extended beyond simple osteoclastic activity, demonstrating alterations in the geometry of the ischial bone, particularly a shift towards thinner, more curved bone sections.

Analysis of the bone microstructure revealed a decrease in the overall thickness distribution, with a greater proportion of bone sections falling within the thinner range. This suggests a complex interplay between bone resorption and potentially reduced bone formation. Furthermore, the researchers identified evidence of osteocytic osteolysis, characterized by changes in the morphology of lacunar surfaces, potentially contributing to the observed bone loss.

Cellular analysis indicated that spaceflight triggered a cell cycle arrest in osteogenic cells, as evidenced by the upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1a/p21. This arrest likely contributed to the diminished bone formation observed. The study’s findings highlight the multifaceted mechanisms underlying bone loss in microgravity, moving beyond a simple model of osteoclast-mediated resorption. The observed changes in bone geometry and cell cycle regulation provide valuable insights into the long-term consequences of spaceflight on skeletal health and suggest potential targets for mitigating bone loss during extended missions. The study’s data supports the hypothesis that reduced mechanical stimulation in spaceflight can disrupt bone homeostasis, leading to both direct bone loss and alterations in cellular activity."
PMC11988870,"Microgravity’s profound influence on biological systems is increasingly recognized, offering valuable insights for both space medicine and terrestrial health. This research comprehensively examines the effects of minimal gravitational forces on cellular processes, revealing significant disruptions across multiple biological domains. The study highlights a compromised immune system, with microgravity inducing impaired T cell activation, reduced cytokine production, and macrophage dysfunction, increasing susceptibility to infections. Furthermore, it demonstrates a shift in macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, hindering effective immune responses.

In cancer biology, microgravity promotes the formation of spheroid structures mimicking in vivo tumor dynamics, particularly in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, providing a novel model for oncology research. It also enhances tissue regeneration by modulating key pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, leading to improved stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells cultured under microgravity exhibited enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, presenting potential therapeutic opportunities for cardiac diseases.

At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. The research emphasizes the impact on cellular signaling pathways, including RAS, ERK, and NF-κB, which are crucial for cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses. The study’s findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity – safeguarding astronaut health during space missions and driving advancements in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued investigation into these effects is essential for mitigating risks associated with prolonged space travel and for harnessing microgravity’s unique environment to develop transformative biomedical innovations on Earth."
PMC7998608,"This study investigates a novel culture technique for expanding human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) with enhanced stress resilience and differentiation potential. Researchers developed a dynamic microgravity culture system utilizing polystyrene and collagen microspheres to mimic a weightless environment, aiming to overcome limitations associated with traditional adherent culture methods. The core innovation lies in the continuous, three-dimensional shaking of cells suspended on these microcarriers, effectively creating a microgravity condition.

The experiment demonstrated that hASCs cultured under this dynamic microgravity system exhibited significantly increased SSEA-3 positivity – a marker of Muse cells known for their stress durability – compared to standard adherent cultures. Furthermore, the microgravity environment promoted cell survival and proliferation under various stress conditions, including heat, low pH, proteolysis, hypotonia, and mechanostress. 

Specifically, the continuous shaking minimized gravitational forces, preventing the formation of cell clumps and ensuring uniform nutrient and oxygen distribution. This resulted in a more homogeneous cell population with improved stress tolerance. The study’s findings suggest that this microgravity culture system offers a promising approach for generating highly functional hASCs, potentially enhancing their utility in regenerative medicine applications by improving their ability to withstand challenging conditions and promoting robust differentiation. The research highlights the importance of environmental factors in shaping stem cell behavior and opens avenues for optimizing hASC expansion strategies."
PMC5587110,"During Increment 47/SPX-8 aboard the International Space Station, NASA’s WetLab-2 system underwent validation to establish a more complex, Earth-like molecular biology laboratory environment. This system, developed specifically for microgravity operations, aimed to facilitate advanced research beyond simple microgravity exposure. WetLab-2 incorporates a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, a centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler, designed for on-orbit biological sample processing and real-time gene expression analysis.

The validation experiments focused on two primary analyses: quantitative PCR using DNA calibration standards and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on RNA extracted from frozen *Escherichia coli* and mouse liver tissue. Crucially, Ct values and PCR efficiencies achieved on the ISS were comparable to those obtained under 1g Earth conditions, demonstrating the system’s accuracy in a microgravity setting. 

Furthermore, the team successfully performed multiplex gene expression analysis within approximately 3 hours, with data transmission occurring within 2 hours of experiment completion. A key challenge identified was the formation of gas bubbles within septa cap assay tubes during thermal cycling, which introduced minor variations in Ct values. This issue was addressed through a rapid follow-up experiment utilizing standard caps to reduce gas release. 

The WetLab-2 system’s successful validation represents a significant step towards realizing the potential of the ISS National Lab as a fully functional, complex research facility. The ability to conduct sophisticated molecular biology experiments in microgravity, coupled with the rapid data transmission capabilities, paves the way for future investigations into biological systems in space. The system’s operational success highlights the feasibility of more intricate wet bench experiments within the ISS environment."
PMC8396460,"This study investigated the molecular changes in murine hearts following 15 days of spaceflight, utilizing a real-time PCR array to assess alterations in genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis pathways. The research found that spaceflight induced significant shifts in gene expression, primarily suggesting an elevated state of oxidative stress and a dampened proliferative response within the heart tissue. 

Specifically, a marked 6.6-fold upregulation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) was observed, indicating increased production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, the expression of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), a key peroxidase enzyme, was downregulated. Furthermore, a notable 2.4-fold reduction in the expression of Nfe2l2, a global transcription factor, was detected. 

Beyond oxidative stress, spaceflight impacted cell cycle regulation. The expression of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1a (P21) was significantly upregulated, while Cdk1 expression decreased.  Additionally, the pro-proliferative gene Myc was upregulated. Importantly, the study revealed a downregulation of inflammatory genes, including Tnf and its receptor superfamily member 10, suggesting a reduced inflammatory response. 

While DNA damage repair genes showed modest increases, no significant changes were observed in apoptosis-related genes like Trp53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp2, or Casp9. The findings highlight a complex interplay of molecular events in the heart during spaceflight, with a clear indication of heightened oxidative stress and a shift towards a less proliferative state, potentially contributing to the physiological challenges associated with long-duration space missions. The research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiovascular adaptation to spaceflight."
PMC5666799,"This study investigated the long-term effects of different types of radiation – protons and 56Fe ions – on bone structure and osteoblastogenesis, aiming to understand the mechanisms behind radiation-induced bone loss relevant to spaceflight. The research utilized both in vivo experiments with mice and in vitro cell culture assays to assess the impact of varying radiation doses and types.

The in vivo study revealed that while both proton and 56Fe irradiation led to significant bone loss, the effect was markedly dependent on the radiation type and dose. Notably, a high dose of 56Fe (200 cGy) at one year post-exposure resulted in persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules, demonstrating a long-lasting impact on osteoblastogenesis.  In contrast, protons exhibited a milder effect.  Interestingly, the study found minimal changes in the steady-state expression of key antioxidant genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, except at the proliferative phase with 56Fe.

Furthermore, the researchers examined the role of oxidative stress. In vitro experiments demonstrated that while adding superoxide dismutase (SOD) mitigated the damaging effects of γ-ray irradiation, it offered limited protection against the effects of heavy-ion irradiation.  The study also documented a transient reduction in body mass following 56Fe irradiation, likely due to shipping delays. 

Overall, the findings suggest that high-LET radiation, particularly 56Fe, significantly impairs osteoblastogenesis and contributes to persistent bone loss, potentially through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and altered gene expression. The study highlights the importance of considering radiation type and dose when evaluating the potential risks of spaceflight on astronaut skeletal health."
PMC5460236,"This paper advocates for a strengthened translational research approach within NASA’s Space Biology and Human Research Program to accelerate the development of countermeasures for astronaut health risks during extended human spaceflight missions. Recognizing a critical need to bridge the gap between basic scientific discoveries and operational applications, the authors propose a two-phased translational pathway: basic-to-applied research and applied-to-operational implementation. Drawing heavily on the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) successful “Translational Pipeline,” the paper emphasizes the importance of bi-directional knowledge flow between basic science and medical operations.

NASA’s current efforts, spearheaded by the recently established Space Life and Physical Sciences Research & Applications Division, are presented as a positive step, yet a more coordinated, integrated approach is deemed necessary. The authors highlight the recommendations of the 2009 National Research Council’s “Decadal Survey,” which underscored the need for robust animal research alongside human studies to drive translational progress. 

The paper illustrates this with four specific examples – immune response, microbe-host interactions, oxidative stress, and visual impairment – demonstrating the potential for synergy between the Space Biology program’s focus on model organisms and the Human Research Program’s work with astronauts.  NASA’s involvement in translational research is increasingly viewed as essential to minimize risks associated with exploration class missions. 

Ultimately, the paper argues for a collaborative, integrated research community, aligning NASA with the broader NIH model to efficiently address the complex challenges of human space exploration and ensure the safety and well-being of astronauts undertaking missions beyond low-Earth orbit. The authors propose a strategic roadmap for NASA to capitalize on existing programs and foster a more dynamic and responsive research environment."
PMC6222041,"This research details the development and validation of a precise ex vivo method for assessing bone quality through cyclic compressive loading of mouse vertebral bodies. Recognizing the challenges of accurately measuring bone behavior in small animals due to machine compliance and specimen variability, the team created a novel technique incorporating 3D-printed jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces, pivotable loading platens for uniform contact, and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis. This approach allowed for the calculation of force levels that would induce the same strain in each specimen, minimizing scatter and maximizing statistical power.

The core of the method involves quantifying vertebral stiffness using micro-CT data and applying this value in a finite element analysis to determine the required force for cyclic loading. The researchers then conducted cyclic loading experiments on mouse vertebral bodies, comparing the results to a previously established method. The new method demonstrated significantly reduced variability in fatigue life, indicating a more reliable assessment of bone mechanical properties. 

Specifically, the team measured key micro-architectural parameters – trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number (Tb.N), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp) – alongside the overall fatigue life. The results highlighted the importance of achieving plano-parallel specimen surfaces and the ability to account for individual specimen variations through the use of a computationally derived stiffness value. This innovative approach offers a robust and reproducible method for evaluating bone mechanical properties, potentially contributing to a better understanding of bone aging, osteoporosis, and other bone diseases. The study’s findings underscore the value of combining micro-CT imaging with finite element analysis for precise bone biomechanical characterization."
PMC6813909,"This research investigated the effects of ionizing radiation on the mechanical and biochemical properties of mouse lumbar vertebrae, aiming to clarify the dominant mechanisms behind radiation-induced bone degradation. The study utilized a controlled ex vivo experiment exposing mouse vertebrae to varying doses of radiation – 0, 50, 1,000, 17,000, and 35,000 Gy – mirroring clinically relevant radiation therapy and allograft sterilization levels. Researchers assessed both mechanical properties and biochemical markers of collagen damage.

The core findings revealed a dose-dependent reduction in vertebral strength and fatigue life. Specifically, higher radiation doses resulted in a significant decrease in compressive force capacity and a shortened fatigue life, indicating a direct correlation between radiation exposure and bone weakening. Furthermore, the study identified collagen fragmentation as a key contributor to this degradation. Analysis via electrophoresis demonstrated a shift in collagen molecular weight distribution towards smaller fragments with higher radiation doses, confirming a breakdown of the collagen network. 

Alongside mechanical changes, the research quantified non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks – specifically, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) – and found a dose-dependent increase in these crosslinks with higher radiation exposure. This suggests that radiation promotes the formation of intra- and inter-fibrillar crosslinks within the collagen matrix. 

Ultimately, the study strongly suggests that collagen fragmentation is the primary driver of radiation-induced bone weakening, supported by the observed shift in collagen molecular weight and the accumulation of AGEs. The research provides valuable insights into the complex mechanisms underlying radiation damage to bone, potentially informing strategies for mitigating its effects."
PMC4095884,"This study investigates the role of the γ-SG muscle complex in mechanotransduction, specifically examining its contribution to muscle degeneration observed in the γ-SG-null mouse model. Researchers explored signaling pathways activated by passive stretch in both C2C12 myotubes and primary mouse muscle fibers, comparing responses between C57 and γ-SG-null mice. The findings highlight the critical function of the SG complex in regulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to mechanical stress.

In C2C12 myotubes, stretching induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and p70S6K, with ERK1/2 phosphorylation being calcium-dependent, indicating a potential role for calcium-mediated signaling. Notably, p70S6K activation was independent of calcium, suggesting a distinct mechanism. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that in primary mouse muscle fibers, γ-SG is required for inactivation of p70S6K following stretch. This suggests that the SG complex acts as a sensor, modulating downstream signaling pathways.

The γ-SG-null mouse exhibits severe dystrophic features, mirroring the mdx mouse, and this research provides further evidence that aberrant load-sensing contributes to this pathology. The study’s identification of p70S6K as a key regulator underscores the importance of the SG complex in maintaining sarcolemmal integrity and preventing muscle degeneration. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex signaling networks involved in muscle adaptation to mechanical stress and highlight the potential therapeutic implications of targeting these pathways in muscular dystrophies."
PMC3040128,"This research investigates the functional relationship between Arabidopsis thaliana’s RabD2 family members, specifically AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c, and their impact on reproductive development. The study highlights a significant functional overlap between these two Rab GTPases, demonstrating that mutations in either gene result in a shortened silique phenotype when grown under specific light conditions. Through careful characterization of T-DNA insertion mutants, researchers identified a novel double mutant (AtrabD2b/2c) exhibiting a pronounced reduction in silique length, a key indicator of reproductive impairment.

The core finding is that while AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a show minimal correlation with AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c expression patterns, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant displays a significant defect in silique development. Notably, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant exhibited a reduced fertilization rate, with approximately half of the ovules failing to develop into seeds. This phenotype was not observed in either the single AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c mutants.

The research emphasizes the importance of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in regulating reproductive processes, likely through their roles in vesicle trafficking and cellular organization. The study’s meticulous analysis, including the identification of the AtrabD2b/2c mutant and its characteristic silique phenotype, provides valuable insights into the complex functions of the Rab GTPase family within plant development. The findings suggest a critical, yet previously unappreciated, role for these proteins in silique formation and seed production."
PMC3177255,"This study identifies and characterizes TNO1, a novel protein localized to the TGN of *Arabidopsis thaliana*, revealing its critical role in vacuolar trafficking and salt stress resistance. Researchers initially identified TNO1 through immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing an antibody against a 66-kD fragment of the protein, which was detected in a 200-kD band within a SYP41 immunoprecipitate. Subsequent analysis confirmed TNO1’s membrane association through differential centrifugation and membrane association tests, demonstrating its presence in all membrane fractions. 

The research highlights TNO1’s involvement in facilitating efficient vacuolar trafficking, evidenced by its co-localization with SYP41 and its detection in membrane fractions. Importantly, a knockout mutant of *tno1* exhibited a heightened sensitivity to salt and osmotic stress, suggesting a direct contribution to plant stress tolerance. This sensitivity was likely linked to partial mislocalization of SYP61, another component of the SYP41 SNARE complex. 

TNO1 is predicted to have six coiled-coil domains, suggesting a potential role in protein-protein interactions, and possesses a transmembrane domain at its C-terminus. The ubiquity of TNO1 expression across various *Arabidopsis* tissues, including roots, leaves, flowers, and stems, indicates its broad functional significance. The study’s findings position TNO1 as a key regulator of vacuolar trafficking and a significant contributor to plant adaptation to environmental stressors. Further research will likely focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms by which TNO1 mediates these functions, potentially revealing novel targets for improving plant stress resilience."
PMC11500582,"This study investigates the function of AtGTLP, a novel Arabidopsis protein identified as a potential glycosyltransferase, focusing on its subcellular localization and potential impact on plant development. Researchers utilized transgenic lines expressing AtGTLP fused to monomeric green fluorescent protein (mGFP) alongside established organelle marker lines to visualize its distribution within the plant cell.

Initial observations revealed that AtGTLP predominantly localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and Golgi apparatus, exhibiting strong colocalization with several established TGN markers, including ST-mRFP and mRFP-SYP61. Furthermore, AtGTLP displayed significant overlap with the Golgi apparatus, confirmed through colocalization with mRFP-GOS12. These findings suggest a key role for AtGTLP within the plant’s Golgi-mediated secretory pathway.

Interestingly, the study also examined two T-DNA insertion lines (atgtlp-1 and atgtlp-2) carrying mutations in the AtGTLP gene. Analysis of these mutant lines revealed a significant reduction in primary root length and fresh mass, indicating a developmental role for AtGTLP.  RNA extraction and RT-PCR confirmed that the AtGTLP gene was indeed downregulated in the mutant lines, suggesting a direct causal link between AtGTLP expression and root growth.

The research highlights AtGTLP as a potentially important player in plant cell wall biosynthesis and/or other Golgi-dependent processes, contributing to root development. Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the specific functions of AtGTLP and its contribution to plant physiology. The study’s methodology, combining subcellular localization with mutant analysis, provides a strong foundation for future research into this novel Arabidopsis protein."
PMC5387210,"This research investigates the role of the TGN-localized protein, TNO1, in regulating root movement, specifically skewing and waving, in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. The study builds upon previous observations that slanted agar plates induce characteristic root movement patterns, and that mutants with altered movement phenotypes can aid in identifying genes involved. Researchers found that TNO1 is critical for modulating root skewing, with *tno1* knockout mutants exhibiting significantly enhanced skewing compared to wild-type plants. This heightened skewing was accompanied by increased epidermal cell file rotation, a key component of the waving phenotype.

Interestingly, the increased skewing observed in *tno1* mutants was dependent on microtubule stabilization, but insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule array orientation remained unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the enhanced cell file rotation wasn’t directly linked to altered MT organization.  The researchers utilized propidium iodide staining to visualize microtubule organization, confirming that while MTs were present, their orientation didn’t contribute to the exaggerated skewing.

Furthermore, the study revealed a connection between TNO1 and the trans-Golgi network, demonstrating that TNO1’s disruption leads to mis-sorting of vacuolar cargo and altered TGN dynamics. This highlights the protein’s role in regulating trafficking pathways, potentially influencing cell wall component transport and overall root development. The findings suggest that TNO1 acts as a negative regulator of root skewing, contributing to the complex interplay of factors governing directional root growth. The research provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying root movement and the critical role of the TGN in plant development."
